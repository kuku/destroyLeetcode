## Minimum Steps To One
**Problem Statement:** On a position integer, you can perform any one of the following 3 steps. **1.)** Subtract 1 from it.(n = n - 1) **2.)** If its divisible by 2, divide by 2. (if n % 2== 0, then n = n / 2). **3.)** If its divisible by 3, divide by 3. (If n % 3 == 0, then n= n / 3). 

**Now the question is, given a positive integer n, find the minimum number of steps that takes n to 1**.
